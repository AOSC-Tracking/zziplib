## Exported Functions 

The ZZipLib Project does already provide THREE libraries. The classic
zziplib.so (via "zzip/lib.h") is the most prominent one and used in
a number of different projects. The zzipfseeko.so ("zzip/fseeko.html")
and zzipmmapped.so ("zzip/mmapped.html") are technology demonstrations.

* [ zzip/lib.h ](zzip/lib.h)- Main User Library
* [ zzip/mmapped.h ](zzip/mmapped.h)- MMap Library
* [ zzip/fseeko.h ](zzip/fseeko.h)- Fseeko Library

Additionally, there is a complete set of unpacked documentation - the
unix manual pages are translated to html manual pages.

* [zzip man pages](manual)
