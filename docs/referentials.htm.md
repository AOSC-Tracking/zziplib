## ZZIP Referentials 
Where is it used.

<!--noborder-->

### GPL Rant 

> The GPL/LGPL do not have a clause like MPL and others to notify the
> original author about certain usages of the library - that's a pity
> since I do not get to know many of the areas where zziplib has come
> to be used. I can only ask you to send me an e-mail, so I can put a
> link from here to your project. Within thousands of downloads less
> than a handful of people wrote to me - mostly for having found a bug
> or having a feature request. Be nice, and write even if you have had
> successfully implanted zziplib in your project... I love to hear that ;-)

### opensource games 

> Although the library has not been written focusing on game data,
> it has it greatest success just there. The SDL-rwops example did
> further it by great amounts, people just like it to have the
> thousand of small bitmaps to be assembled into one big dat file,
> and put the AI scripts just next to them.

### opensource apps/libs 

> Here the most important feature has been the smalls size of this
> library and the possible to use its autoconf script and even for
> those who don't, it is easy to make a custom configuration. The
> source code is easy to understand and therefore to customize for
> the needs of the app/lib that wants to use the functionality.

  ### commercial usage 

> For commercial usage, you can bind many small files into a zip
> file for easier handling. Obfuscation and io-wrapping help
> greatly to implant it in areas even far from posix-io grounds.
